- Topic: Gaussian Process Regression on telecommunication data

## Data
- hw_device: processor
- hw_model: mobile phone model
- lon, lat: coordinates
- RSSNR: Reference Signal Signal-to-Noise Ratio
  - Signal to noise ratio, measured using a certain reference signal
- RSRP: Reference Signal Received Power
  - received power at the mobile device
  - used by the mobile phone to determine best cell tower to use
- CQI: Channel Quality Indicator^
  - value for signal quality
  - influenced by signal strength, noise, intereference levels, etc.
- model: mobile phone model (again?)
- RSRQ: Reference Signal Received Quality
  - ratio between signal power and noise, inference power
- RSSI: Received Signal Strength Indicator
  - only shows absolute received signal power
