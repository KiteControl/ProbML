# The origins of Kriging [@cressie1990origins]
Contains citations for original conceiver of kriging methods. Apparently, predicting a statistic between some known observations has been called kriging in geostatistics.

[Comprehensive article on Kriging](https://www.publichealth.columbia.edu/research/population-health-methods/kriging-interpolation#:~:text=Kriging%20can%20be%20understood%20as,blocks%20across%20the%20spatial%20field).

Note that geostatisticians often talk about creating "Variograms". What they are doing is estimating the kernel parameters and then calculating covariance matrices. In opposition to our view, they seem to see these as a function over distance values, not as a function over simply two points.

The kernels typically used seem to be the Exponential Kernel, linear kernel and spherical kernel.

They too simply vary those across problems.
